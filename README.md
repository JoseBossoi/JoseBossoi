## 👋 Hi, I’m José

I am currently engaged in a **structured transition into Software Engineering**, focusing on **Full-Stack Web Development (JavaScript/TypeScript)** and progressively expanding toward **Python, AI applications, and cloud-native systems**.

After 15 years in Brazilian federal public service, I bring experience in **analytical reporting, structured documentation, and problem-solving within regulated environments** that require responsibility and precision.

This GitHub profile documents my **project-driven learning process**, where I build practical systems step by step to consolidate technical foundations and evolve consistently in the technology field.

---

## 🎯 Current Focus (Now)

- Fundamentals of **Web Development** (HTML, CSS, modern JavaScript)
- **Git & GitHub** workflows and version control
- Introductory **React** and **Node.js**
- Translating real-world problems into small, functional software systems

I am intentionally progressing step by step, prioritizing **solid foundations over speed**.

---

## 🧭 Learning Roadmap (High-Level)

My long-term goal is to work as a **Full-Stack / AI-oriented Software Engineer**, capable of designing, building, and evolving real products.

**Roadmap overview:**
- **Phase 1:** Web fundamentals + first complete CRUD project
- **Phase 2:** Full-Stack JS/TS + APIs + databases + Python intro
- **Phase 3:** Backend Python + applied AI (LLMs, RAG)
- **Phase 4:** Architecture, cloud-native, and AI solutions engineering

Each phase is reflected here through repositories, commits, and documentation.

## 🛠️ Projects (In Progress)

- **Mini-CRM Rural**  
  A learning project focused on CRUD fundamentals, data modeling, and simple deployments.

- **MercadoRaiz** *(future phases)*  
  A more ambitious platform combining backend systems, data processing, and AI-assisted features.

Projects evolve incrementally, with emphasis on clarity, documentation, and solid technical foundations.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Mindset

I value:
- Clear communication
- Incremental improvement
- Mutual learning
- Honest feedback

I’m open to collaborations, study groups, code reviews, and conversations with people building real things — especially those who enjoy thinking about **systems, trade-offs, and long-term maintainability**.
