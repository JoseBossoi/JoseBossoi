## About

I am currently engaged in a **structured transition into Software Engineering**, focusing on **Full-Stack Web Development (JavaScript/TypeScript)** and progressively expanding toward **Python, AI applications, and cloud-native systems**.

After 15 years operating in regulated, high-accountability environments within Brazilian federal public service, I bring experience in **analytical reporting, structured documentation, and problem-solving within regulated environments** that require responsibility and precision.

This GitHub profile documents a **project-driven evolution**, where I build real systems step by step to consolidate strong technical foundations.

## AI-Enhanced & Product-Oriented Approach

I intentionally align my development process with:

- AI-assisted engineering workflows  
- Product thinking principles  
- Architectural reasoning  

I aim to design coherent systems that address validated real-world problems through thoughtful engineering — not just write code.

---

## 🎯 Current Focus (Now)

- Fundamentals of **Web Development** (HTML, CSS, modern JavaScript)
- **Git & GitHub** workflows and version control
- Introductory **React** and **Node.js**
- **Problem & customer discovery**: validating pain points, defining a niche, and shaping early value propositions before building solutions

I am intentionally progressing step by step, prioritizing **solid foundations over speed**.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration & Structured Feedback

My roadmap is intentionally designed as a long-term evolution plan.

I particularly value structured feedback on:

- Roadmap architecture and progression logic  
- Integration of AI-enhanced development practices
- Product thinking maturity across phases

I am open to collaborations, code reviews, and conversations about systems, AI-enhanced workflows, and product-oriented engineering.
