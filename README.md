# 👋 Welcome to My Personal Repository!
I am solidifying my career transition into the field of Information Technology, applying the analytical and strategic expertise gained over 16 years of public service in Brazil, including 15 years as a Federal Agent with the Brazilian Federal Police. My professional journey has provided me with a unique ability to solve complex problems, think critically, and make strategic and creative decisions, skills that I am now leveraging in software development and artificial intelligence.
This repository is a space where I share my projects, learning progress, and specialization journey in Software Engineering and Development, with a focus on solving complex problems and creating innovative, scalable solutions for the global market.

## 📌 About Me
Having dedicated a significant part of my life as an athlete and coach, specializing in Sports Training Science for high-performance combat athletes, I am also a former intelligence analyst and investigator with the Brazilian Federal Police, strategically transitioning into the tech industry. In the Federal Police, I worked on operations and investigations against international drug trafficking and violent crimes, utilizing telecommunication and telematic interception tools, contributing to and leading investigative teams in collaboration with Brazilian and international security agencies (Força Aérea Brasileira - F.A.B., Drug Enforcement Administration - D.E.A., and JOINT INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE SOUTH - JIATFS). I also worked in administrative law enforcement, overseeing firearm and ammunition regulations, airport security, and immigration control and regularization. My career blends _**complex problem-solving, creativity, analytical thinking, and personal resilience.**_
Currently, I am focused on enhancing my technical skills and expanding my overall knowledge in Full Stack Software Developer (IBM Professional Credential) and Prompt Engineering, with an emphasis on efficiency, automation, and innovation. Additionally, I am improving my soft skills through courses in negotiation, productivity techniques and tools, time management, and mental health.
