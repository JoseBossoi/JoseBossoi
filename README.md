# 👋 Welcome to My Personal Repository!

I am solidifying my career transition into the field of Information Technology, applying the analytical and strategic expertise gained over 16 years of public service in Brazil, including 15 years as a Federal Agent with the Brazilian Federal Police. My professional journey has provided me with a unique ability to solve complex problems, think critically, and make strategic and creative decisions, skills that I am now leveraging in software development and artificial intelligence.
This repository is a space where I share my projects, learning progress, and specialization journey in Software Engineering and Development, with a focus on solving complex problems and creating innovative, scalable solutions for the global market.

## 📌 About Me
Having dedicated a significant part of my life as an athlete and coach, specializing in Sports Training Science for high-performance combat athletes, I am also a former intelligence analyst and investigator with the Brazilian Federal Police, strategically transitioning into the tech industry. In the Federal Police, I worked on operations and investigations against international drug trafficking and violent crimes, contributing to and leading investigative teams in collaboration with Brazilian and international security agencies (Força Aérea Brasileira - F.A.B., Drug Enforcement Administration - D.E.A., and JOINT INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE SOUTH - JIATFS) and utilizing telecommunication and telematic interception tools. I also worked in administrative law enforcement, overseeing firearm and ammunition regulations, airport security, and immigration control and regularization. My career blends _**complex problem-solving, creativity, analytical thinking, and personal resilience.**_
Currently, I am focused on enhancing my technical skills and expanding my overall knowledge in _programming, web development, UX/UI, generative artificial intelligence and machine learning, prompt engineering, and software engineering,_ with an emphasis on efficiency, automation, and innovation. Additionally, I am improving my soft skills through courses in _negotiation, productivity techniques and tools, time management, and mental health._
